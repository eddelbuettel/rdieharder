 * This is the Diehard Squeeze test, rewritten from the description
 * in tests.txt on George Marsaglia's diehard site.
 *
 *               This is the SQUEEZE test                        ::
 *  Random integers are floated to get uniforms on [0,1). Start- ::
 *  ing with k=2^31=2147483647, the test finds j, the number of  ::
 *  iterations necessary to reduce k to 1, using the reduction   ::
 *  k=ceiling(k*U), with U provided by floating integers from    ::
 *  the file being tested.  Such j's are found 100,000 times,    ::
 *  then counts for the number of times j was <=6,7,...,47,>=48  ::
 *  are used to provide a chi-square test for cell frequencies.  ::
 *
 *                   Comment on SQUEEZE
 * This adaptation fixes a number of screwy fortranisms in the
 * original code.  First of all, the actual bin probabilities were
 * presented scaled up by 10^6 (suitable for 10^6 trials).  Then
 * they were multipled by 0.1.  Finally the test was run for 10^5
 * trials.  Now we just input the vector of actual bin probabilities
 * as doubles (naturally) and scale the probabilities by tsamples.
 * This yields the expected bin frequencies much more simply and
 * in a way that permits tsamples to be varied.
 *
 * Honestly, from my limited experimentation, this test is uselessly
 * insensitive on at least the rng's in the GSL with a few notable
 * exceptions (the worst of the worst).  It passes a number of
 * generators with known, serious flaws though.  Not that a lot of
 * tests in diehard ARE terribly  good at picking out particular
 * flaws in particular generators -- they're struggling to identify
 * bad generators at all.  Sorry, but that's just the way I see it.
