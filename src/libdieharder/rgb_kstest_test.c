 *========================================================================
 * A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test using Anderson-Darling tests a set of
 * deviates for uniformity.  So does Kuiper KS.  The AD in this suite has
 * been "symmetrized" so that it is not left biased, and is now very
 * similar to the algorithm in R.  Kuiper was invented in the first place
 * to be a symmetric test and has cyclic symmetry, not sensitive to
 * the end points of the test interval.
 *
 * The test is simple.  Fill a test vector with uniform deviates from the
 * default generator.  Run the selected KS test on them, and record the
 * pvalue in the test's vector of pvalues to pass back to the front end
 * for histogram graphing and/or a final KS test to a test pvalue.
 * 
 * This test has two purposes.  One is that it is a legitimate test of
 * rngs, although one that is perhaps too expensive to use for very large
 * tsamples because it can require the input data to be sorted.  The
 * other, more important one, is to allow me and other test developers
 * a platform to gain experience in interpreting the final set of
 * ks pvalues formed from a test of the uniformity of psamples pvalues
 * from individual tests.  These appear to be consistently biased high
 * for psamples = 100 even for what should be very good rngs, and I
 * want to see what happens when I form a large set of ks pvalues of (say)
 * 100 tsamples drawn directly as uniform deviates from known good
 * generators, ones that I am CERTAIN have no detectable bias of this
 * sort on only 100 samples.
