 * This is the Diehard sums test, rewritten from the description
 * in tests.txt on George Marsaglia's diehard site.
 *
 *             The  OVERLAPPING SUMS test                        ::
 * Integers are floated to get a sequence U(1),U(2),... of uni-  ::
 * form [0,1) variables.  Then overlapping sums,                 ::
 *   S(1)=U(1)+...+U(100), S(2)=U(2)+...+U(101),... are formed.  ::
 * The S's are virtually normal with a certain covariance mat-   ::
 * rix.  A linear transformation of the S's converts them to a   ::
 * sequence of independent standard normals, which are converted ::
 * to uniform variables for a KSTEST. The  p-values from ten     ::
 * KSTESTs are given still another KSTEST.                       ::
 *
 *                       Comments
 * 
 * From the papers I've collected, the reason for the overlap is
 * simply to use all of the data when observing whether or not
 * the quantities are uniformly distributed.  The use of a
 * covariance matrix doesn't test anything different, it just
 * uses fewer rands to achieve a given sensitivity.  I would therefore
 * strongly suggest that users use the far more sensitive and reliable
 * rgb_lagged_sum test which tests more or less the same thing in an
 * unbroken and scalable way.
 *
 * At this point I think there is rock solid evidence that this test
 * is completely useless in every sense of the word.  It is broken,
 * and it is so broken that there is no point in trying to fix it.
 * If I crank up tsamples to where one can actually see the asymptotic
 * distribution (which should be uniform) it is visibly non-uniform and
 * indeed the final kstest CONVERGES to a non-zero pvalue of 0.09702690
 * for ALL rngs tested, which hardly seems useful.  If one runs the test
 * on only 100 samples (as Marsaglia's code did in both the original
 * fortran or the newer C version) but then increases the number of
 * runs of the test from the default 100, it is easy to make it fail for
 * gold standard generators.  The test just doesn't work.  It cannot be
 * used to identify a generator that fails the null hypothesis.
 *
 * Don't use it.

  * SUMS requires that we evaluate y[i] = \sum_i^{100+i} u[i].  Naturally,
  * the sum (or mean, if you prefer) is supposedly normally distributed
  * according to the central limit theorem.  So each number has an
  * associated p-value -- the probability of that particular number
  * occurring from the random sum.  The vector of p-values can be turned
  * into an overall p-value via a KS test.
  *
  * I have a set of really good papers on this.  One is on nilpotent
  * Markov chain tests communicated by  Janusz Kawczak.  A whole
  * series of better ones have come from Stefan Wegankittl.  In fact,
  * Stefan give more or less an exact prescription for writing this
  * sort of test in terms of the weak inverse of its covariance matrix.
  *
  * Unfortunately, Marsaglia's description is pretty opaque, at least
  * to a poor ignorant physicist like myself.  I quote:
  *
  *   The y's covariance matrix T is Toeplitz with diagonals 100,99,...2,1
  *   A Cholesky factorization of T: V'V = T provides M=V^(-1).  The
  *   covariance of x = yM is M'TM=I.  The columns of M have at most
  *   3 non-zero elements.
  *
  * Ouch!  Toeplitz used as an adjective!  Cholesky factorization!
  * What means these strange terms?  OK, here's what Wikipedia has
  * to say:  A Toeplitz matrix is a "diagonal constant matrix".  This
  * means that all elements on the parallel diagonals are the same, so
  * the prescription above actually tells one exactly what T is.
  *
  * Cholesky decomposition takes a symmetric positive definite matrix
  * and decomposes it into a lower triangular matrix and the transpose
  * of the lower triangular matrix, where the lower triangular matrix
  * is called the Cholesky triangle.  It is primarily used to compute
  * the solution to Ax = b via A = LL^T (really LL^* but L is real),
  * solving Ly = b (which is easy, just "backsubstitution"), then
  * solving L^T x = y for x.
  *
  * Translated, this means (I think) that we form T = VV^T, invert
  * M = V^(-1), and then form x = My (where y is a set of overlapping
  * sums).  This converts y back to an ordinarly multivariate normal
  * with a chisq distribution with 100-1 degrees of freedom (where the
  * latter I'm not quite certain of).  But again Wegankittl will help
  * me rewrite the test from scratch, I think.
  *
  * Generators that fail when the number of test samples is only 100 PASS
  * when I crank up the number of samples to around 200 or 300, then fail
  * consistently with a distribution of p that is now biased LOW (where
  * before it was biased HIGH) for all the "best" rngs in the GSL.
  * Again, this suggests that there is a very subtle error somewhere but
  * is far from definitive.  If you are a real stats person and a coder
  * and are reading this, PLEASE consider helping out by figuring this
  * out and contributing a fix -- otherwise I'll fix it (or at least
  * address it) when I have time to get to it.

  * A run of diehard_sums with tsamples = psamples = 100
