  * should serve our purpose of providing a sufficiently random and
  * uniformly distributed seed.
  *
  * It falls back on the clock, which is a POOR choice.  I really should
  * use the clock to seed a good rng (e.g. mt19937), generate a
  * random integer in the range 1-100, discard this number of rand and use
  * the next one as the seed (for example).  The point isn't to get a
  * perfectly random seed -- it is to get a uniform distribution of possible
  * seeds.
