 *
 *  GSL packaged for dieharder by Robert G. Brown 6/5/07
 *
 *  Alex has agree to make this available under the GSL so it can be
 *  integrated with the dieharder package.
 *
 *  Here is pretty much the only documentation on this generator in
 *  existence, at least until dieharder-based studies enable a real
 *  publication to occur.  The following is from Alex:
 *
 * UVAG: The Universal Virtual Array Generator
 *
 * This generator is universal in the sense that a single algorithm
 * can be used to produce random numbers with any integer data TYPE.
 * Thus it is trivial to extend it to 64 bits and beyond.  If and when
 * long long = 128 bits, UVAG is ready to go.
 *
 * The array is virtual in that when TYPE>char the 256 inner TYPES overlap
 * producing an effectively huge "virtual" inner complexity in a very small
 * physical memory. When TYPE = uint, every cycle changes 4-7 (depending on
 * where rp is pointing in the array) virtual TYPEs in the array.  When
 * TYPE = long long each cycle changes 8-15 virtual TYPES at a physical
 * memory cost of just 4 bytes over uint for the entire array.
 *
 * As sindex is incremented, its next potential value has been changed many
 * times since it was last encountered along with the entire inner state.
 * Not very rigorous but then I'm no mathematician.  UVAG is something I
 * would dub a chaotic prng.  It doesn't yield easily to mathematical
 * analysis unlike well researched prngs like MT and RC4.  I have
 * experimented using fewer than 256 seeds.  Fewer than 100 do well in
 * DIEHARD.  The cost is in speed due to an extra mod.
 *
 * Where did UVAG come from?
 *
 * It evolved over years of playing around.  In its previous incarnation, rp
 * was moved randomly and proved (as Makoto Matsumoto predicted) to zero out
 * after extended cycling. Systematically stepping thru the array with sindex
 * seems to eliminate the problem although I have not consulted further with
 * Dr Matsumoto.
