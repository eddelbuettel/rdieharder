 * This is the Diehard Count a Stream of 1's test, rewritten from the
 * description in tests.txt on George Marsaglia's diehard site.
 *
 *     This is the COUNT-THE-1's TEST on a stream of bytes.      ::
 * Consider the file under test as a stream of bytes (four per   ::
 * 32 bit integer).  Each byte can contain from 0 to 8 1's,      ::
 * with probabilities 1,8,28,56,70,56,28,8,1 over 256.  Now let  ::
 * the stream of bytes provide a string of overlapping  5-letter ::
 * words, each "letter" taking values A,B,C,D,E. The letters are ::
 * determined by the number of 1's in a byte::  0,1,or 2 yield A,::
 * 3 yields B, 4 yields C, 5 yields D and 6,7 or 8 yield E. Thus ::
 * we have a monkey at a typewriter hitting five keys with vari- ::
 * ous probabilities (37,56,70,56,37 over 256).  There are 5^5   ::
 * possible 5-letter words, and from a string of 256,000 (over-  ::
 * lapping) 5-letter words, counts are made on the frequencies   ::
 * for each word.   The quadratic form in the weak inverse of    ::
 * the covariance matrix of the cell counts provides a chisquare ::
 * test::  Q5-Q4, the difference of the naive Pearson sums of    ::
 * (OBS-EXP)^2/EXP on counts for 5- and 4-letter cell counts.    ::
 *
 *                       Comment
 *
 * For the less statistically trained amongst us, the translation
 * of the above is:
 *  Generate a string of base-5 digits derived as described from
 * random bytes (where we by default generate NON-overlapping bytes
 * but overlapping ones can be selected by setting the overlap flag
 * on the command line).
 *  Turn four and five digit base 5 numbers (created from these digits)
 * into indices and incrementally count the frequency of occurrence of
 * each index.
 *  Compute the expected value of these counts given tsamples samples,
 * and thereby (from the vector of actual vs expected counts) generate
 * a chisq for 4 and 5 digit numbers separately.  These chisq's are
 * expected, for a large number of trials, to be equal to the number of
 * degrees of freedom of the vectors, (5^5 - 1) or (5^4 - 1).  Generate
 * the mean DIFFERENCE = 2500 as the expected value of the difference
 * chisq_5 - chisq_4 and compute a pvalue based on this expected value and
 * the associated standard deviation sqrt(2*2500).
 *
 * This test is written so overlap can be flag-controlled and so that
 * tsamples can be freely varied compared to diehard's presumed 256,000.
 * As usual, it also runs at 100 times and not 10 to generate the final
 * KS pvalue for the test.
 *
 * One can easily prove that this test will fail whenever rgb_bitdist
 * fails at 40 bits and pass when rgb_bitdist passes, as rgb_bitdist
 * tests the much more stringent requirement that the actual underlying
 * 40 bit strings are correctly distributed not just with respect to
 * the morphed number of 1 bits but with respect to the actual underlying
 * bit patterns.  It is, however, vastly less sensitive -- rgb_bitdist
 * already FAILS at six bit strings for every generator thus far tested,
 * meaning that two OCTAL digits WITHOUT any transformations or bit counts
 * are already incorrectly distributed.  It is then perfectly obvious that
 * all bitstrings with higher numbers of bits will be incorrectly
 * distributed as well (including 40 bit strings), but count_the_1s is
 * distressingly insensitive to this embedded but invisible failure.
