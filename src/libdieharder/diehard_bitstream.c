 *========================================================================
 * This is the Diehard BITSTREAM test, rewritten from the description
 * in tests.txt on George Marsaglia's diehard site.
 *
 *                   THE BITSTREAM TEST                          ::
 * The file under test is viewed as a stream of bits. Call them  ::
 * b1,b2,... .  Consider an alphabet with two "letters", 0 and 1 ::
 * and think of the stream of bits as a succession of 20-letter  ::
 * "words", overlapping.  Thus the first word is b1b2...b20, the ::
 * second is b2b3...b21, and so on.  The bitstream test counts   ::
 * the number of missing 20-letter (20-bit) words in a string of ::
 * 2^21 overlapping 20-letter words.  There are 2^20 possible 20 ::
 * letter words.  For a truly random string of 2^21+19 bits, the ::
 * number of missing words j should be (very close to) normally  ::
 * distributed with mean 141,909 and sigma 428.  Thus            ::
 *  (j-141909)/428 should be a standard normal variate (z score) ::
 * that leads to a uniform [0,1) p value.  The test is repeated  ::
 * twenty times.                                                 ::
 *
 * Except that in dieharder, the test is not run 20 times, it is
 * run a user-selectable number of times, default 100.
 *========================================================================
 *                       NOTE WELL!
 * If you use non-overlapping samples, sigma is 290, not 428.  This
 * makes sense -- overlapping samples aren't independent and so you
 * have fewer "independent" samples than you think you do, and
 * the variance is consequently larger.
 *========================================================================

  * samples drawn from this field.  At some point, I should be able
