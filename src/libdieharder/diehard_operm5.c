 * This is the Diehard OPERM5 test, rewritten from the description
 * in tests.txt on George Marsaglia's diehard site.
 *
 *          THE OVERLAPPING 5-PERMUTATION TEST                   ::
 * This is the OPERM5 test.  It looks at a sequence of one mill- ::
 * ion 32-bit random integers.  Each set of five consecutive     ::
 * integers can be in one of 120 states, for the 5! possible or- ::
 * derings of five numbers.  Thus the 5th, 6th, 7th,...numbers   ::
 * each provide a state. As many thousands of state transitions  ::
 * are observed,  cumulative counts are made of the number of    ::
 * occurences of each state.  Then the quadratic form in the     ::
 * weak inverse of the 120x120 covariance matrix yields a test   ::
 * equivalent to the likelihood ratio test that the 120 cell     ::
 * counts came from the specified (asymptotically) normal dis-   ::
 * tribution with the specified 120x120 covariance matrix (with  ::
 * rank 99).  This version uses 1,000,000 integers, twice.       ::
 *
 * Note -- the original diehard test almost certainly had errors,
 * as did the documentation.  For example, the actual rank is
 * 5!-4!=96, not 99.  The original dieharder version validated
 * against the c port of dieharder to give the same answers from
 * the same data, but failed gold-standard generators such as AES
 * or the XOR supergenerator with AES and several other top rank
 * generators.  Frustration with trying to fix the test with very
 * little useful documentation caused me to eventually write
 * the rgb permutations test, which uses non-overlapping samples
 * (and hence avoids the covariance problem altogether) and can
 * be used for permutations of other than 5 integers.  I was able
 * to compute the covariance matrix for the problem, but was unable
 * break it down into the combination of R, S and map that Marsaglia
 * used, and I wanted to (if possible) use the GSL permutations
 * routines to count/index the permutations, which yield a different
 * permutation index from Marsaglia's (adding to the problem).
 *
 * Fortunately, Stephen Moenkehues (moenkehues@googlemail.com) was
 * bored and listless and annoyed all at the same time while using
 * dieharder to test his SWIFFTX rng, a SHA3-candidate and fixed
 * diehard_operm5.  His fix avoids the R, S and map -- he too went
 * the route of directly computing the correlation matrix but he
 * figured out how to transform the correlation matrix plus the
 * counts from a run directly into the desired statistic (a thing
 * that frustrated me in my own previous attempts) and now it works!
 * He even made it work (correctly) in overlapping and non-overlapping
 * versions, so one can invoke dieharder with the -L 1 option and run
 * what should be the moral equivalent of the rgb permutation test at
 * -n 5!
 *
 * So >>thank you<< Stephen!  Thank you Open Source development
 * process!  Thank you Ifni, Goddess of Luck and Numbers!  And anybody
 * who wants to tackle the remaining diehard "problem" tests, (sums in
 * particular) should feel free to play through...
