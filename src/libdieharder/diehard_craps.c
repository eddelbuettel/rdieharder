/*
 *========================================================================
 * This is the Diehard Craps test, rewritten from the description
 * in tests.txt on George Marsaglia's diehard site.
 *
 *: This is the CRAPS TEST. It plays 200,000 games of craps, finds::
 *: the number of wins and the number of throws necessary to end  ::
 *: each game.  The number of wins should be (very close to) a    ::
 *: normal with mean 200000p and variance 200000p(1-p), with      ::
 *: p=244/495.  Throws necessary to complete the game can vary    ::
 *: from 1 to infinity, but counts for all>21 are lumped with 21. ::
 *: A chi-square test is made on the no.-of-throws cell counts.   ::
 *: Each 32-bit integer from the test file provides the value for ::
 *: the throw of a die, by floating to [0,1), multiplying by 6    ::
 *: and taking 1 plus the integer part of the result.             ::
