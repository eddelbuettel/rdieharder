#                       RGB Permutations Test\n\
# This is a non-overlapping test that simply counts order permutations of\n\
# random numbers, pulled out n at a time.  There are n! permutations\n\
# and all are equally likely.  The samples are independent, so one can\n\
# do a simple chisq test on the count vector with n! - 1 degrees of\n\
# freedom.  This is a poor-man's version of the overlapping permutations\n\
# tests, which are much more difficult because of the covariance of the\n\
# overlapping samples.\n\
