# absolutely equivalent to just counting the 01 + 10 bit pairs.\n\
# It is therefore totally redundant with but not as good as the\n\
# rgb_bitdist() test for 2-tuples, which looks beyond the means to the\n\
# moments, testing an entire histogram  of 00, 01, 10, and 11 counts\n\
# to see if it is binomially distributed with p = 0.25.\n\
