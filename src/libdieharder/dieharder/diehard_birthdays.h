#                Diehard \"Birthdays\" test (modified).\n\
# Each test determines the number of matching intervals from 512\n\
# \"birthdays\" (by default) drawn on a 24-bit \"year\" (by\n\
# default).  This is repeated 100 times (by default) and the\n\
# results cumulated in a histogram.  Repeated intervals should be\n\
# distributed in a Poisson distribution if the underlying generator\n\
# is random enough, and a a chisq and p-value for the test are\n\
# evaluated relative to this null hypothesis.\n\
#\n\
# It is recommended that you run this at or near the original\n\
# 100 test samples per p-value with -t 100.\n\
#\n\
# Two additional parameters have been added. In diehard, nms=512\n\
# but this CAN be varied and all Marsaglia's formulae still work.  It\n\
# can be reset to different values with -x nmsvalue.\n\
# Similarly, nbits \"should\" 24, but we can really make it anything\n\
# we want that's less than or equal to rmax_bits = 32.  It can be\n\
# reset to a new value with -y nbits.  Both default to diehard's\n\
# values if no -x or -y options are used.\n\
