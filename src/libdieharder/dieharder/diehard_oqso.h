#   Diehard Overlapping Quadruples Sparce Occupancy (OQSO) Test\n\

#  Similar, to OPSO except that it considers 4-letter \n\
#  words from an alphabet of 32 letters, each letter determined  \n\
#  by a designated string of 5 consecutive bits from the test    \n\
#  file, elements of which are assumed 32-bit random integers.   \n\
#  The mean number of missing words in a sequence of 2^21 four-  \n\
#  letter words,  (2^21+3 \"keystrokes\"), is again 141909, with   \n\
#  sigma = 295.  The mean is based on theory; sigma comes from   \n\
#  extensive simulation.                                         \n\
