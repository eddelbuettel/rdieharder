/*
 * This is is the std_test struct.  It is the sole output interface between
 * the user and the test program -- all standard test inputs and returns
 * are passed through this struct.  A test can have additional user-settable
 * arguments, of course, but they must be passed in GLOBAL SHARED VARIABLES
 * defined just for the particular test in question.  This is a bit ugly,
 * but so are void *args argument lists and va_start/va_end for multiple
 * layers of passing arguments.
 *
 * This is silly.  We clearly need for each test to have access to all
 * variables set on the command line.  That way the ONE Test object
 * can be passed to e.g report() or table() and they'll know exactly
 * what to do with it.
