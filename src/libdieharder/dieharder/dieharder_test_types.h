 * This program initializes a permanent internal vector of pointers to all
 * the tests known to dieharder that generate a pvalue or vector of
 * pvalues.  With it we abandon our former addressing of tests by source
 * (the -d, -r, -s testnumber invocation) in favor of a segmented single
 * number.  There is initial room for up to 1000 tests, but this can easily
 * be increased.
 *
 * We define the ranges:
 *
 *   0-99    diehard (or Marsaglia & Tsang) based tests.
 *   100-199 the NIST STS
 *   200-499 everything else.
 *   500-999 reserved for future sets of "named" tests if it seems
 *           reasonable to use it that way, or straight expansion
 *           space otherwise.  500 tests will hold us for a while...
