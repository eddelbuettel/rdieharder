 *========================================================================
 * This is the Diehard Parking Lot test, rewritten from the description
 * in tests.txt on  George Marsaglia's diehard site.
 *
 * ::               THIS IS A PARKING LOT TEST                      ::
 * :: In a square of side 100, randomly "park" a car---a circle of  ::
 * :: radius 1.   Then try to park a 2nd, a 3rd, and so on, each    ::
 * :: time parking "by ear".  That is, if an attempt to park a car  ::
 * :: causes a crash with one already parked, try again at a new    ::
 * :: random location. (To avoid path problems, consider parking    ::
 * :: helicopters rather than cars.)   Each attempt leads to either ::
 * :: a crash or a success, the latter followed by an increment to  ::
 * :: the list of cars already parked. If we plot n:  the number of ::
 * :: attempts, versus k::  the number successfully parked, we get a::
 * :: curve that should be similar to those provided by a perfect   ::
 * :: random number generator.  Theory for the behavior of such a   ::
 * :: random curve seems beyond reach, and as graphics displays are ::
 * :: not available for this battery of tests, a simple characteriz ::
 * :: ation of the random experiment is used: k, the number of cars ::
 * :: successfully parked after n=12,000 attempts. Simulation shows ::
 * :: that k should average 3523 with sigma 21.9 and is very close  ::
 * :: to normally distributed.  Thus (k-3523)/21.9 should be a st-  ::
 * :: andard normal variable, which, converted to a uniform varia-  ::
 * :: ble, provides input to a KSTEST based on a sample of 10.      ::
 *
 *                         Comments
 *
 *    First, the description above is incorrect in two regards.
 *    As seen in the original code, the test measures
 *    overlap of SQUARES of radius one, a thing I only observed after
 *    actually programming circles as described (which are
 *    also easy, although a bit more expensive to evaluate crashes
 *    for).  Circles produce an altogether different mean and are
 *    probably a bit more sensitive to 2d striping at arbitrary angles.
 *
 *    Note that I strongly suspect that this test is basically
 *    equivalent to Knuth's better conceived hyperplane test, which
 *    measures aggregation of N dimensional sets of "coordinates" in
 *    hyperplanes.  To put it another way, if something fails a
 *    hyperplane test in 2d, it will certainly fail this test as well.
 *    If something fails this test, I'd bet serious money that it
 *    is because of aggregation of points on hyperplanes although
 *    there MAY be other failure patterns as well.
 *
 *    Finally, note that the probability that any given k is
 *    obtained for a normal random distribution is just determined
 *    from the erf() -- this is just an Xtest().
 *
 * As always, we will increase the number of tsamples and hopefully improve
 * the resolution of the test.  However, it should be carefully noted
 * that modern random number generators can almost certainly add many
 * decimal places to the simulation value used in this test.  In other
 * words, test failure at higher resolution can be INVERTED -- it can
 * indicate the relative failure of the generators used to produce the
 * earlier result!  This is really a subject for future research...
