 *========================================================================
 * This is a test that checks to see if the rng generates bit patterns
 * (n-tuples) that are distributed correctly (binomially).  For example,
 * for 2-tuples (bit pairs) there are four possibilities: 00, 01, 10, 11.
 * Each should occur with a probability of 1/4, hence the count of (say) K
 * 00 bitpairs out of N trials should be distributed (over M samples)
 * according to the binomial probability p = binomial(N,K,0.25) -- that
 * is, the expected count for k 00's is M*p(N,K,0.25).
 *
 * This test should be more sensitive than just doing a large number of
 * trials and aggregating all the 00's over all the samples and comparing
 * the result to the expected mean, as there can be distributions that
 * have the expected mean of 0.25 that are >>not<< binomially distributed.
 *
 * By making a single program capable of doing any n-tuple, we gain
 * immediate benefit.  Both STS and Diehard, for example, contain
 * tests that validate bit distribution frequencies; however, they typically
 * do so for specific n-tuples, e.g. 5 in several diehard tests.  There
 * is nothing terribly special about 5, and no point in looking too
 * hard at e.g. intervals between patterns at 5, since testing pure
 * frequency at 6 bits simultaneously ensures that all 6 bit patterns have
 * the correct frequency (since they are sub-patterns of 6 bit patterns
 * that have the correct frequency, and if they had the INcorrect frequency
 * the six-bit patterns would as well by inheritance) and (less obviously,
 * but I'm pretty sure I can prove it) that intervals between the five
 * bit patterns must also be correct IF the test is satisfied robustly
 * for various arbitrary test string lengths and sampling counts.
 *
 * Anyway, I'm giving this one a shot as it may end up being a one-size
 * fits all tool for validating bitlevel randomness for any generator,
 * up to some n-tuple.  I expect that 2004/2005 computers will easily
 * be able to validate through n=8 without really warming up or taking
 * terribly long (validating the frequency and distribution for e.g.
 * the entire ascii alphabet at the byte level) and MAY be able to do
 * actual frequency validation on 16-bit integers.  Note that it only takes
 * a few seconds to generate millions of 32 bit integers with most of
 * the GSL routines.  To get statistically valid results, one needs to
 * accumulate order of 100 trials per outcome, or test order of millions
 * of integers and accumulate the results in an outcome vector 64K long.
 * both of these are well within reach using at most hours of CPU time,
 * and partitioned on a beowulf might take only minutes or even seconds.
 *
 * The latest version of the actual test (below) tests only ONE ntuple,
 * the value set in the global variable rgb_bitdist_ntuple which must
 * be a positive integer.  The calling program is responsible for e.g.
 * testing a range of ntuples.
