/*
 * ========================================================================
 * This is the Diehard OPSO test, rewritten from the description
 * in tests.txt on George Marsaglia's diehard site.
 *
 *         OPSO means Overlapping-Pairs-Sparse-Occupancy         ::
 * The OPSO test considers 2-letter words from an alphabet of    ::
 * 1024 letters.  Each letter is determined by a specified ten   ::
 * bits from a 32-bit integer in the sequence to be tested. OPSO ::
 * generates  2^21 (overlapping) 2-letter words  (from 2^21+1    ::
 * "keystrokes")  and counts the number of missing words---that  ::
 * is 2-letter words which do not appear in the entire sequence. ::
 * That count should be very close to normally distributed with  ::
 * mean 141,909, sigma 290. Thus (missingwrds-141909)/290 should ::
 * be a standard normal variable. The OPSO test takes 32 bits at ::
 * a time from the test file and uses a designated set of ten    ::
 * consecutive bits. It then restarts the file for the next de-  ::
 * signated 10 bits, and so on.                                  ::
 *
 * Note: Overlapping samples must be used to get the right sigma.
 * The tests BITSTREAM, OPSO, OQSO and DNA are all closely related.
 *
 * This test is now CORRECTED on the basis of a private communication
 * from Paul Leopardi (MCQMC-2008 presentation) and Noonan and Zeilberger
 * (1999), Rivals and Rahmann (2003), and Rahmann and Rivals (2003).
 * The "exact" target statistic (to many places) is:
 * \mu  = 141909.3299550069,  \sigma = 290.4622634038

  * We now make test[0]->tsamples measurements, as usual, to generate the

  * Each pair of "letters" generated become indices, and a (char) 1
  * is inserted there.  At the end we just loop the matrix and count
  * the zeros.
  *
  * Of course doing it THIS way it is pretty obvious that we could,
  * say, display the 2-color 1024x1024 bitmap this represented graphically.
  * Missing words are just pixels that are still in the background color.
  * Hmmm, sounds a whole lot like Knuth's test looking for hyperplanes
  * in 2 dimensions, hmmm.  At the very least, any generator that produces
  * hyperplanar banding at 2 dimensions should fail this test, but it is
  * possible for it to find distributions that do NOT have banding but
  * STILL fail the test, I suppose.  Projectively speaking, though,
  * I have some fairly serious doubts about this, though.
