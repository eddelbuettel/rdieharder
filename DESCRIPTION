Title: R interface to the dieharder RNG test suite
Description: The RDieHarder packages provides an R interface to the 
   dieharder suite of random number generators and tests that was
   developed by Robert G. Brown (rgb), extending earlier work by George
   Marsaglia and others.
   .
   At the suggestion of Linas Vepstas on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
   list, this GPL'd suite of random number tests will be named
   "DieHarder". Using a movie sequel pun for the name is a double tribute to
   George Marsaglia, whose "Diehard battery of tests" of random number
   generators has enjoyed years of enduring usefulness as a test suite. 
   .
   The DieHarder suite is more than just the diehard tests cleaned up and
   given a pretty GPL'd source face in native C. Tests from the Statistical
   Test Suite (STS) developed by the National Institute for Standards and
   Technology (NIST) are being incorporated, as are new tests developed by
   rgb. Where possible or appropriate, all tests that can be parameterized
   ("cranked up") to where failure, at least, is unambiguous are so
   parameterized and controllable from the command line. 
   .
   A further design goal is to provide some indication of why a generator
   fails a test, where such information can be extracted during the test
   process and placed in usable form. For example, the bit-distribution tests
   should (eventually) be able to display the actual histogram for the
   different bit ntuplets. 
   .
   DieHarder is by design extensible. It is intended to be the "Swiss Army
   Knife of random number test suites", or if you prefer, "the last suite
   you'll ever ware" for testing random numbers.
